Per the [Linux Foundation Vulnerability Disclosure Policy](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/security), if you find a vulnerability in a project maintained by the Open Source Security Foundation (OpenSSF), please report that directly to the project maintaining that code, preferably using GitHub's [Private Vulnerability Reporting](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/guidance-on-reporting-and-writing/privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability#privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability) in the project repository ([ossf/security-insights-spec](https://github.com/luigigubello/security-insights-spec)).

If you've been unable to find a way to report it, or have received no response after repeated attempts,
please contact the OpenSSF security contact email, [security@openssf.org](mailto:security@openssf.org).

Thank you ðŸ¦„
